So, I finally managed to collect enough courage to publish a blog to the internet, Hurray !

For a virtual_vagabond type people like me, who can't organize anything :P i think it is a daunting challenge to regularly maintain a blog.

Actually Octopress is what that encouraged me to open a blog, for a command line freak, it is just <3 <3 , **create**, **manage**, **write new posts** :D all from sweet terminal, who need anything else ?

I'll be using the great markdown editor [Mou](http://mouapp.com) and [iTerm2](www.iterm2.com) for this.
